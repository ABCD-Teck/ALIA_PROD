# ALIA Issue Categories & Fix Plan

## Issue Categories
- **Customer Insights & Interactions** – Navigation gaps and data visibility problems (e.g., #67 home list doesn’t open detail pages, #66 numbering, #65 leverage metric clarity, #42 search accuracy, #41 missing “Add interaction”, #24 filters, #23/#22 cross-links and status badges, #21 highlight “Select customer”, #18 manual ordering, #9 financial tiles blank, #5 lack of customer URLs).
- **News & Market Insights** – Feed freshness, filtering failures, and inert social actions (e.g., #64 stale data, #56 region filter errors, #55 IW event date bug, #35 reactions no-op, #34 custom tags, #33 incomplete source links, #32 default date mismatch, #31 modal readability, #17 region labels, #54 forced translation overlay, #52 translate button, #30 confusing importance badge, #13 filter reload errors).
- **Tasks & Calendar** – Productivity affordances missing (#45 calendar should default to current user and offer richer filters, #44 task sorting, #26 column filtering).
- **Dashboard & Settings Surface** – Shell interactions unimplemented (#38 Settings Save inert, #37 avatar doesn’t open settings, #36 notification bell idle, #28 unclear “Send”, #12 dashboard counters lack drilldowns, #20 “Annotation” wording mismatch).
- **Auth, Profiles & Permissions** – Identity handling, profile editing, role scopes (#29 username stuck on Andrew, #25 profile edit missing, #16 admin overview, #15 seeded data for new accounts, #14 registration failure, #7 permissions design).
- **Platform, Data & Integrations** – Broader architectural asks (#27 Outlook sync, #19 on-prem data autofill, #6 MIA/OpenAI availability, #3 responsive layout, #2 multi-org SaaS).

## Fix Plan
1. **Stabilize auth/profile flows**: Harden `/register` in `server/routes/auth.js`, persist user profile settings via API consumed by `src/components/pages/Settings.tsx`, and replace hard-coded user info in `src/components/Navbar.tsx` plus wire the bell/send buttons and Settings save (#14, #29, #25, #38, #37, #36, #28).
2. **Repair news/market ingestion & interactions**: Ensure region/tag endpoints in `server/routes/marketInsights.js` gracefully handle empty results, bring back scheduled ingests via `miaPipeline`, wire “Translate Full Text” in `src/components/pages/ArticleModal.tsx`, and connect like/bookmark actions in `src/components/pages/MarketInsights.tsx` to backend endpoints while cleaning up importance/region badges (#64, #56, #55, #35, #34, #33, #32, #31, #17, #54, #52, #30, #13).
3. **Elevate Customer Insights UX**: Add customer detail navigation and status badges in `src/components/pages/CustomerInsights.tsx`, connect “Add interaction” CTA to APIs, rename annotation copy to “Comments/Notes,” hook financial cards to `server/routes/financialStatements.js`, and store manual ordering/numbering preferences (#67, #66, #65, #42, #41, #24, #23, #22, #21, #18, #9, #5, #20).
4. **Ship tasks/calendar productivity upgrades**: Extend `server/routes/tasks.js` with sort/filter params, surface sortable headers and column filters in `src/components/pages/TaskManager.tsx`, and default calendar filters to the logged-in user with richer activity types in `src/components/pages/Calendar.tsx` (#45, #44, #26).
5. **Lay groundwork for permissions/integrations**: Introduce tenant-aware scopes and admin overrides in `server/routes/customers.js` and related controllers, define role claims in middleware, plan Outlook sync + responsive layout + SaaS multi-org strategy, and document on-prem data ingestion expectations (#16, #15, #7, #27, #19, #6, #3, #2).
